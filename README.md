# Tip Calculator

## Description

This simple Python program calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill at a restaurant, including a tip. It prompts the user for the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people sharing the bill.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the script:** Execute the Python script in your terminal or Python environment.
2.  **Input the total bill:** When prompted, enter the total amount of the bill in Brazilian Reais (R$) and press Enter.
3.  **Input the tip percentage:** Enter the desired tip percentage (10, 12, or 15) and press Enter.
4.  **Input the number of people:** Enter the number of people who will be splitting the bill and press Enter.
5.  **Result:** The program will then calculate and display the amount each person needs to pay, rounded to two decimal places.
