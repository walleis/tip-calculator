Tip Calculator
Welcome to the Tip Calculator, a simple Python program designed to help you quickly calculate the tip and split the bill among a group of people. Whether you're dining out or sharing expenses, this tool makes it easy to determine how much each person owes.

How It Works:
The program prompts the user to enter the total bill amount.
The user inputs the desired tip percentage (e.g., 10, 15, 20).
The user specifies how many people are splitting the bill.
The calculator computes the total amount (bill + tip) and divides it evenly, showing the amount each person should pay.

Requirements:
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system. No additional libraries are needed since this uses only built-in functionality.

Installation:
Download or clone this repository to your computer.
Verify that Python is installed by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal.
Run the program by opening a terminal in the project folder and typing:
python tip_calculator.py
